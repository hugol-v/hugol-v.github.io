**Abstract**: Hessian matrices are crucial to the study of optimization and machine learning algorithms. Based on the work of the work of Zhenyu Liao and Michael W. Mahoney, I will present an exact asymptotic characterization of the Hessian eigenspectrum for a large family of statistical models in high dimensions. More precisely, I will introduce a limiting spectral measure theorem and discuss its implications.
