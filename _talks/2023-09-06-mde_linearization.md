**Abstract**:
Random matrix theory has proved to be a valuable tool for understanding puzzling aspects of machine learning models. There are various methods in random matrix theory, each depending on different structural assumptions for the given problem. One of these methods essentially suggests that we can analyze the spectrum of a large random matrix by substituting the associated random resolvent with the solution of a deterministic fixed-point equation known as the matrix Dyson equation.
In this talk, based on collaborative work with KC Tsiolis and Elliot Paquette, I will discuss the extension of the matrix Dyson equation framework to analyze rational expressions in random matrices using a linearization trick. I will also provide an illustrative example by applying our framework to study the test error of a random feature model.
