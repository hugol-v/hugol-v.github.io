**Abstract**:
This presentation provides an overview of the article "High-Dimensional Limit Theorems for SGD: Effective Dynamics and Critical Scaling" by GÃ©rard Ben Arous, Reza Gheissari, and Aukosh Jagannath. The article investigates the behavior of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant step-size in high-dimensional settings. The authors demonstrate that the online stochastic gradient trajectory can be approximated by a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To help illustrate the main concepts of the paper, I will go through examples of applying SGD to a spiked matrix PCA problem and a two-layer network for binary Gaussian mixture classification.
