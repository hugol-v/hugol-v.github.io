**Conference**: The Undergraduate Student Research Conference at McGill University aims to provide undergraduate students an opportunity to present the summer research project that they have conducted.

**Abstract**: Machine learning algorithms are often trained using a large set of samples in a high-dimensional
feature space. The traditional methods that performed well for low-dimensional problems can run
into several problems in analyzing such high-dimensional models. One difficulty is that the analysis
can depend on the probability distribution of the inputs. However, we show that this is not the
case for a model of large-scale spiked random least squares problem trained with gradient descent.
In fact, we show and verify experimentally that the halting time exhibits a universality property:
it is independent of the probability distribution of the inputs. Furthermore, we provide explicit
asymptotic results and discuss the effect of various parameters on those asymptotics.
