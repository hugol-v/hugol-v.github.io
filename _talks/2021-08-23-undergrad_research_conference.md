The Undergraduate Student Research Conference at McGill University aims to provide undergraduate students an opportunity to present the summer research project that they have conducted. I gave a short (virtual) presentation
during which I motivated average case complexity in high-dimensional settings and presented our contribution. To summarize, we were interested in a
large-scale spiked random least squares problem trained with gradient descent and showed both empirically and theoretically that the halting time exhibits a universality phenomenon. Additionaly, we
provided explicit asymptotics results.
