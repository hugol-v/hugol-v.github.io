Welcome to my academic website! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I have the privilege of working under the co-supervision of [Professor Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Professor Elliot Paquette](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science with First-Class Honours, also from McGill University.

My academic interests revolve around the fascinating realm of large random systems. I see data science and machine learning as exciting avenues for theoretical exploration, using tools from random matrix theory, high-dimensional probability, optimization and statistics, into the complexities of high-dimensional systems. My research has led me to study theoretical aspects of random matrix theory, notably the matrix Dyson equation. I have also explored the applications of random matrix theory to machine learning, notably by establishing a Gaussian equivalence result for the empirical test error of random features ridge regression. For a slightly more detailed discussion, please refer to the "research" tab.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I like to engage in physical activities. Snorkeling, kayaking, and skiing are among my favorite pastimes. In an alternate reality, I might have been known as a "gym bro."

## Some news

* I am grateful for the opportunity to present my work on the matrix Dyson equation for correlated linearization at the workshop “The many facets of random matrix theory”, which was part of the [2023 Winter meeting of the Canadian Mathematical Society](https://www.winter23.cms.math.ca/). It was a pleasure to meet everyone and to learn about the exciting research being done in the field of random matrix theory.
* I am happy to announce that, along with Noah Marshall, I will be co-organizing [the Montreal RMT-ML-OPT Seminar](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/rmtmloptseminar.html) at McGill University during the Fall 2023 semester.
* I am grateful for the invitation extended to me to participate in the 2023 [Princeton Machine Learning Theory Summer School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/), which occurred from June 26th to June 30th. It has been an invaluable opportunity for me to enhance my knowledge through engaging courses and connect with a remarkable cohort of PhD students in the field of machine learning theory. I would like to extend a special appreciation to [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) for his exceptional organization of the summer school.
