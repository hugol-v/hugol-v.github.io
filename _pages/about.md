Welcome to my (new) academic website! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I have the privilege of working under the co-supervision of [Professor Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Professor Elliot Paquette](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science with First-Class Honours, also from McGill University.

My academic interests revolve around the fascinating realm of large random systems. Specifically, I find great enthusiasm in applying random matrix theory to unravel the reasons behind the exceptional performance of contemporary machine learning models trained on massive datasets. I also strive to understand their vulnerabilities, exploring situations in which they may encounter breakdowns. I have a strong inclination to explore diverse subjects and actively seek opportunities for collaborations. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the "research" tab.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I like to engage in physical activities. Snorkeling, kayaking, and skiing are among my favorite pastimes. In an alternate reality, I might have been known as a "gym bro."

## Some news
* I am happy to announce that, along with Noah Marshall, I will be co-organizing [the Montreal RMT-ML-OPT Seminar](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/rmtmloptseminar.html) at McGill University during the Fall 2023 semester. 
* I am grateful for the invitation extended to me to participate in the 2023 [Princeton Machine Learning Theory Summer School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/), which occurred from June 26th to June 30th. It has been an invaluable opportunity for me to enhance my knowledge through engaging courses and connect with a remarkable cohort of PhD students in the field of machine learning theory. I would like to extend a special appreciation to [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) for his exceptional organization of the summer school.
