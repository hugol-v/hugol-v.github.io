I am a M.Sc. student in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) 
where I am fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor Courtney Paquette and to extensively
collaborate with Professor Elliot Paquette. I also obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science
with First-Class Honours from McGill University.

Academically, I am currently interested in the intricate interplay between data properties and the behaviour of 
various optimization algorithms. I use tools from random matrix theory to perform a high dimensional analysis
of foundational machine learning procedures. I like to learn about various subjects and I am always open to collaborations.

Otherwise, I generally enjoy physical activities such as snorkeling, kayaking and skiing.
