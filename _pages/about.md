Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics and Data Science at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), supervised by [Theodor Misiakiewicz](https://misiakie.github.io/). I completed my Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I had the privilege of working under the co-supervision of [Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Elliot Paquette](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science with First-Class Honours, also from McGill University.

My academic interests revolve around the study of large random systems and their role in modern data science and machine learning. I approach these problems from a theoretical perspective, drawing on tools from random matrix theory, high-dimensional probability, optimization, and statistics to understand the behavior of complex high-dimensional models. I am particularly interested in how ideas from probability can shed light on learning algorithms and their fundamental limits. For a more detailed description of my research, please see the "research" tab.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I like to engage in physical activities. Snorkeling, kayaking, and skiing are among my favorite pastimes. In an alternate reality, I might have been known as a "gym bro."
