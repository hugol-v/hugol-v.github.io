**Abstract**: This paper develops some theory of the matrix Dyson equation (MDE) for
correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression. The theory developed for the
correlated MDE includes existence-uniqueness, spectral support bounds, and stability
properties of the MDE. This theory is new for constructing deterministic equivalents for
pseudoresolvents of a class of correlated linear pencils. In the application, this theory is
used to give a deterministic equivalent of the test error in random features ridge regression, in a proportional scaling regime, wherein we have conditioned on both training and
test datasets.
