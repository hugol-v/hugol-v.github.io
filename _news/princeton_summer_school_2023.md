I am grateful for the invitation extended to me to participate in the [2023 Princeton Machine Learning Theory Summer School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/previous), which occurred from June 26th to June 30th. It has been an invaluable opportunity for me to enhance my knowledge through engaging courses and connect with a remarkable cohort of PhD students in the field of machine learning theory. I would like to extend a special appreciation to Boris Hanin for his exceptional organization of the summer school.
