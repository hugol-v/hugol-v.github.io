My master's thesis has been posted on the [McGill University eScholarship](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900p100w?locale=en) website. This marks the end of my master's degree at McGill University, and the beginning of my Ph.D. journey at Yale University. I am grateful for the support of my supervisors and the academic community at McGill. I look forward to continuing my journey in the field of statistics and data science at Yale.
