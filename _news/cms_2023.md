I had the opportunity to present my work on the matrix Dyson equation for correlated linearization at the workshop “The many facets of random matrix theory”, which was part of the [2023 Winter meeting of the Canadian Mathematical Society](https://cmssmc.wixsite.com/winter23/). It was a pleasure to meet everyone and to learn about the exciting research being done in the field of random matrix theory.
