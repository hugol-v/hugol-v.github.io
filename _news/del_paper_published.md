Our paper [Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and test error of random features regression](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/epdf/10.1142/S2010326325500261) has been published in [Random Matrices: Theory and Applications](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/RMTA). In this work, we develop a Dyson-equation framework for analyzing correlated block linearizations and apply it to obtain precise deterministic equivalents for the empirical test error of random features ridge regression, establishing a Gaussian equivalence principle for this setting.
