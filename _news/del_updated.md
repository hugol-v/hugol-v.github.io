It took us longer than expected, but we finally updated the preprint for our Dyson equation work. The new title is *Dyson Equation for Correlated Linearizations and Test Error of Random Features Regression*, and it's available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09194v2). While the main content hasn't changed much, we think the new structure makes it easier to follow and better highlights our key results. For instance, our contributions on the Dyson equation are now right in the main text.
