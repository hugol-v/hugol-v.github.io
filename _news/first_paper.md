My first paper is on the arXiv! It is titled [Matrix Dyson equation for correlated linearizations and test error of random features regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09194) and is co-authored with [Elliot Paquette](https://elliotpaquette.github.io/). It develops some theory of the matrix Dyson equation (MDE) for correlated linearizations and uses it to solve a problem on asymptotic deterministic equivalent for the test error in random features regression.
